## Paper Replication: AI Safety via Debate - Convincing a Sparse Classifier

In this post I will go through my current progress in replicating the "convincing a sparse classifier" experiment in Section 3.1 of _AI safety via debate_ (Irving, Christiano, and Amodei 2018).
I haven't fully achieved this goal but I'm posting my current status as my project submission for the Summer 2024 installment of the _AI Safety Fundamentals_ course by BlueDot.

To be a complete replication my goal was to approximately remake most of the same figures and arrive at nearly the same results quoted in that section. To wit, that meant:
1. Figure 2
2. Table 2
3. Figure 3
4. Figure 4
